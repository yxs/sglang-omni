SGLang-Omni
=======================

SGLang-Omni is a high-performance serving framework for omni and multimodal models, built on top of `SGLang <https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang>`_. It is designed to orchestrate multi-stage pipelines with low latency and OpenAI-compatible APIs.

Modern omni models — such as speech-output LLMs and multimodal generation systems — decompose into heterogeneous stages with fundamentally different computational profiles: a compute-bound thinker, a memory-bound talker, a latency-sensitive codec. SGLang-Omni is built around a **computation-centric design**: each stage runs its own independent scheduler tuned to its bottleneck, communicates through a shared inbox/outbox abstraction, and transfers tensors via zero-copy shared memory. This prevents any single stage from degrading the others and allows new models to plug into the framework by declaring a pipeline topology rather than building an inference system from scratch.

About
-----

Core features:

- **Multi-Stage Pipeline**: Flexible framework for orchestrating preprocessing, AR engine, codec, and vocoder stages across processes and GPUs.
- **Native SGLang Integration**: Leverages SGLang's RadixAttention, continuous batching, and CUDA Graph optimizations for the AR backbone.
- **OpenAI-Compatible Server**: Drop-in ``/v1/audio/speech``, ``/v1/audio/transcriptions``, and ``/v1/chat/completions`` endpoints with real-time streaming support.
- **Broad Model Support**: Supports a growing set of TTS, ASR, and omni models including Higgs Audio, Fish Audio S2-Pro, Voxtral TTS, Qwen3 TTS, MOSS-TTS, Qwen3-ASR, Whisper ASR, Qwen3-Omni, Ming-Omni, and LLaDA2.0-Uni.
